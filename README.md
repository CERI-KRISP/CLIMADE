https://climade.health/

This repository is under development and will contain all epidemiological/genomic data, analysis scripts and diagnostics/sequencing protocols related to climate-sensitive infectious diseases in Africa. 

Pathogens of interest are currently vector-borne viruses (e.g. Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, West Nile, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever) and water-borne infections (e.g. Cholera).
